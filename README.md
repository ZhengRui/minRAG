# minRAG: Minimalist RAG Implementation

## Overview

minRAG is a demonstration project showcasing how to build a clean, minimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline without relying on complex frameworks like LlamaIndex. This project aims to provide a clear, customizable alternative to overwrapped designs that can be challenging to modify.

## Usage

To run the minRAG implementation and compare it with the LlamaIndex version:

1. Execute the minimal RAG implementation:
   ```
   python rag_min.py
   ```

2. Run the LlamaIndex-based implementation:
   ```
   python rag_llamaindex.py
   ```

Both scripts will generate the same embeddings and produce equivalent answers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the minimalist approach.
